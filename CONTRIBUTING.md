## Adding New Animation Presets

To add a new animation preset:

1. Determine the appropriate category for your animation (e.g., attention seekers, entrances, exits)
2. Create a new Kotlin file in the appropriate package under `animate-compose/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nomanr/animate/compose/presets/`
3. Extend the `AnimationPreset` interface:

```kotlin
class YourAnimation : AnimationPreset {
    override val name = "YourAnimation"
    override val durationMillis = 1000 // Default duration
    
    override fun createKeyframes(containerSize: ContainerSize): List<Keyframe> {
        return listOf(
            // Define your keyframes here
            Keyframe.static(0f, alpha = 0f),
            Keyframe.segment(
                0f to 1f,
                alpha = SegmentFloat(0f, 1f),
                easing = Easing.EaseInOut
            )
        )
    }
}
```

4. Add your animation to the appropriate category list in `sample/app/common/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nomanr/animate/compose/data/Animations.kt`
5. Test your animation in the playground

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs
- Ensure your code is properly formatted

## Testing

Before submitting your PR:

1. Run the sample apps to verify your changes work correctly
2. Test on multiple platforms if possible (Android, Desktop, Web)
3. Ensure existing animations still work as expected
4. Check that the build passes:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Creating a Pull Request

1. Commit your changes with a clear, descriptive message
2. Push your branch to your fork
3. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository
4. Provide a clear description of your changes
5. Reference any related issues
6. Allow maintainer edits on your PR

## Request for New Animations

If you have ideas for new animations but aren't ready to implement them:

1. Create an issue describing the animation
2. Include reference materials or examples if possible
3. Explain potential use cases

We'd be happy to help implement or guide you through the process!
