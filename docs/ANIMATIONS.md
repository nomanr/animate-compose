## Usage Example

```kotlin
import com.nomanr.animate.compose.animated.Animated
import com.nomanr.animate.compose.presets.attentionseekers.Bounce

@Composable
fun AnimatedButton() {
    Animated(
        preset = Bounce(),
        durationMillis = 1000
    ) {
        Button(onClick = { /* ... */ }) {
            Text("Click Me!")
        }
    }
}
```

## Custom Duration

All animations support custom duration:

```kotlin
Animated(
    preset = FadeIn(),
    durationMillis = 2000 // 2 seconds
) {
    // Your content
}
```

## Combining with Exit Animations

For exit animations, set `animateOnEnter = false`:

```kotlin
Animated(
    preset = FadeOut(),
    animateOnEnter = false,
    state = animatedState
) {
    // Your content
}

// Trigger exit animation
animatedState.animate()
```
